=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InstallRelease - installs your dist after releasing

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 DESCRIPTION

After doing C<dzil release>, this plugin will install your dist so you
are always the first person to have the latest and greatest version. It's
like getting first post, only useful.

To use it, add the following in F<dist.ini>:

    [InstallRelease]

You can specify an alternate install command:

    [InstallRelease]
    install_command = cpanm .

using L<CPAN> (unless you specified something different).
